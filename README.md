This is a voice command window app and it under development so only few features of this app is working 
I am workin on the model to make it much better 
but right now voice recoginiziton is working 
so you can test by downloading mu repositry and run the main.py file and then a window app will open 
Then you have to click voice button 
And it will start to listen and recognize 
you have to say like Play(Video/song name) on youtube
Then it will start to play video on your web browser 
I will add more feature like detecting Hot words,Sending a text message on whatapp,Starting a call on whatsapp and many more feature 
Thank you
